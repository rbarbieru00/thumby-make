# Thumby Make
#### A thumbnail generator with Python

## Functionality
The repository comes with a folder where there is a file named **Thumby-Make.py**. Double-clicking this file will open a command prompt and a file selector dialog. Once you selected the video file you want to create the thumbnail of, Thumby Make will ask you how many thumbnails you want to generate. It will then proceed to generate the thumbnails and when it's done, it will open the file explorer (only works on Windows) to the directory where the thumbnails were saved.
